    //Action: Move, Shoot, Defend, Overwatch

    // move and weight movement heavily for pip one,

    //evaluate shooting based on % to hit, should only shoot first if already in best spot or 100% chance really.

    // defense should be weighted fairly low

    // overwatch similar to defense, maybe should be weighted based on cover of enemy between this and defense.
